# Pythom_Programming_Projects-MOOC-
Selected projects which were completed during Python Programming Course from University of Helsinki


1. Course grading 


- This program works with two CSV files. One of them contains information about some students on a course. The other contains the number of exercises each student has completed each week.The program asks the user for the names of these two files, reads the files, and then prints out the total number of exercises completed by each student. The exam points awarded to each student are contained in a CSV file. The program should again ask the user for the names of the files. Then the program should process the files and print out a grade for each student.

-Each completed exercise is counted towards exercise points, so that completing at least 10 % of the total exercices awards 1 point, completing at least 20 % awards 2 points, etc. Completing all 40 exercises awards 10 points. The final grade for the course is determined based on the sum of exam and exercise points. For (exam points + exercise points) and equivalent grades: 0-14 :	0 (fail) | 15-17	: 1 | 18-20	: 2 | 21-23	: 3 | 24-27	: 4 | 28-	: 5 |

- We now shall print out some statistics based on the CSV files. Each row contains the information for a single student. The number of exercises completed, the number of exercise points awarded, the number of exam points awarded, the total number of points awarded, and the grade are all displayed in tidy columns. The width of the column for the name should be 30 characters, while the other columns should be 10 characters wide.
